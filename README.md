Hi there, I'm Nahid, an experienced researcher and data scientist with a passion for machine learning and AI. With a strong background in statistics and computer science, I'm always looking to push the boundaries of what's possible in the field of data science.

As a researcher at Concordia University's Mathematics and Statistics Department, I focus on exploring new ideas and techniques to improve my skills in data science. I also have experience as a lecturer, where I help students develop a deeper understanding of these complex topics.

On Github, you'll find a collection of my projects and contributions in machine learning and AI, showcasing my expertise in these areas. I'm passionate about open source and enjoy collaborating with others to solve practical problems and drive innovation in the field.

If you're interested in working together or simply want to connect, feel free to reach out to me. I'm always excited to learn from others and explore new opportunities in data science.
